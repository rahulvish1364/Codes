<h2>introduction.js</h2>
<p>
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests. This guide is running against Jasmine version 2.3.0.

<h2>Standalone Distribution</h2>
<p>
The releases page has links to download the standalone distribution, which contains everything you need to start running Jasmine. After downloading a particular version and unzipping, opening SpecRunner.html will run the included specs. You'll note that both the source files and their respective specs are linked in the &lt;head&gt; of the SpecRunner.html. To start using Jasmine, replace the source/spec files with your own.
